# Structure: the Placement Invariants

These rules always apply. The full procedure (placement, thresholds, promotion) lives in the skill
`callbell-ops-filing` and is read only when you actually file or move a file.

**Two levels in the root.** The root separates cleanly. The **operational level** is the flat area
folders `<area>-<topic>` (for example `business-finance/`, `personal-gaming/`) plus the zones `_import/`,
`_export/`, and `_backlog/` (see `callbell-zones`). Alongside it is the **global meta level** `__META__/`
(global context, memory). Area-local meta (`framework.md`), by contrast, lives **in** the operational
level, with the area it sharpens. No deep `domain/area/topic` hierarchy: the area folder is the top
level, depth arises inside it and only when needed.

**Content folders are named `<area>-<topic>`.** The area up front groups related topics and makes the
folder self-explaining for human and agent (`business-finance`, `personal-gaming`). Which areas and
topics exist is set by the registry (below), not by the agent's gut.

**The type is visible in the path.** Every file shows its `type` without being opened: as a file name
prefix (`<type>-<name>.md`) while flat, or as a `<type>/` folder once grouped. Never hide the type.

**The area level stays readable.** Inside a `<area>-<topic>/` there are only flat type files and type
folders. That way a human sees after one click which types exist and that content is there. Anything that
is not a type group (years, ad hoc bundles) belongs in the area's `work/` folder, never out in the open
beside it; otherwise the type folders drown and the pattern is misread. The area-local `work/` is a raw
zone (no type, no frontmatter), like the root zones.

**The path is the structural truth.** Area and topic sit in the folder name, not in the frontmatter. One
place decides the structure: the path.

**Areas come from the registry, not from the gut.** Which areas and topics exist is stated in the
registry in the root `framework.md`. The agent uses only what is there and invents no areas. A new area, a
new topic, or a loosening of the schema requires approval (see `callbell-governance`).

**Status drives maturity, not location.** Unfinished material carries `status: draft` and lives in its
proper place; it matures there in place until `status: active`. There is no separate draft zone: draft
and active state differ by `status`, not by folder. Backlog maturity is set by `callbell-backlog`.

**Folders grow only when needed.** A folder comes into being with its first file, never empty just in
case. A named sublevel appears only once a second element of the same kind is added. An area gets its own
`framework.md` only when it needs growing, distinct work rules (not already covered by the backbone).
